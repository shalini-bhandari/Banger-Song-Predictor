ML Task: Supervised Learning (Classification)
Algorithm: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost
Data Needed: Audio features of songs and a binary label (liked=1, not liked=0).
End Result: A "Song Rater" app where you can search for a song, and the model gives you a "likability score" based on your personal taste profile.


Strategy for finding your "Bangers" (Label = 1):

1. Method A (Easiest): Your "Liked Songs" Library. This is the most explicit signal of a song you love. You can use the Spotify API to get every single song from your "Liked Songs".

2. Method B: High Play Count. You can use your exported StreamingHistory.json data to find songs you've played more than, say, 5 or 10 times. This is an implicit sign of a banger.

3. Method C: Your Personal Playlists. Get all the songs from playlists you've personally curated (e.g., "My Gym Mix," "Road Trip Jams").

Strategy for finding the "Skips" (Label = 0):
A good model needs negative examples. This is tricky because you don't have a "Disliked Songs" playlist. Here's how to create it:

1. Method A (Best): Songs you listened to only once. Analyze your StreamingHistory.json and find tracks you played for less than 30 seconds, or tracks that appear only once in your entire history.

2. Method B: Songs from genres you dislike. Use the Spotify API to find a genre you know you don't like (e.g., "Opera"). Grab a few hundred random tracks from public playlists of that genre.

3. Method C: Random popular songs. Get tracks from a global "Top 100" chart. The assumption is that you haven't explicitly "liked" most of them, so they can serve as neutral or negative examples.
